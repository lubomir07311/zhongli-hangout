    z "Where are those animals chasing you?"
    ats "On the streets of Liyue. I tried to run away, but they kept on catching up to me. The first time they caught up to me was in front of the Wanmin Restaurant. They cornered me and I had nowhere to run."
    p "So how did you escape?"
    ats "I didn't. The pack of animals charged at me full speed. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the impact. I could hear them approaching closer and closer. But once they got to me I woke up screaming. Covered in cold sweat."
    p "That's awful! At least you got out of it safely."

    t "Paimon, stop interrupting the story. It's not polite."

    p "The street where the Scent of Spring is located?"

    z "Yes, Miss Atsuko. It does look like you have indeed caught somebody's attention."
    ats "But... what? How? I... I don't understand? Why me?"
    z "I might be able to answer most of your questions. But I can't promise to answer them all."
    ats "How...?"
    z "There are several ways for an individual to obtain a Vision. The most common way is when an Archon deems an individual worthy, they may grant them a Vision."
    p "But that's an Inazuma Geo Vision. We know that the Electro Archon, that rules over Inazuma in trying to gather all the Visions for herself, not give them away."
    z "That's correct."
    p "And the Geo Archon could not have given her that Vision as well because he is {i}\"not around anymore\" after the event of the Rite of Parting{/i}."
    "{i}*Paimon winks at Zhongli*{/i}"
    p "So there is no way that this Vision came from one of them."
    z "That is also correct. Which rules out this way of obtaining the Vision. Another method is to rekindle a Masterless Vision. This happens when a deceased individual's Vision resonates with somebody new."
    p "Atsuko, when you got the Vision, was it empty? Like a blank rock in the middle? Or was it always orange with the Geo symbol?"
    ats "It was orange, as far as I recall."
    z "Which means only one thing - the Vision chose you. The Vision of a deceased person can also resonate with somebody close to the original Vision bearer."
    ats "This is someone else's Vision?"
    z "It was. Now it's yours."
    ats "But... that other person..."
    z "They are not around anymore. You have to carry on the Vision's legacy as its chosen one."
    ats "The Vision's chosen one? But why?"
    z "This question, I cannot answer. The reasons are beyond me. If we keep on exploring this narrative, we might get to the answer though."
    ats "Why is it glowing orange and why is there a Geo symbol on it specifically?"
    z "It could be that the Vision is trying to help you accustom to the local culture. Since Liyue is the land of Geo, what better way to integrate in this society, than to wield the power of the local element?"
    ats "I left Inazuma to be as far away as possible from the power of Visions and the Electro Archon. I don't want to end up like the previous bearer of this Vision."
    p "Don't look at it negatively. Try to see it as a gift. A gift that you can control."
    ats "But... I can't control it. Oh no... Does that mean that I caused all the attacks? They weren't just dreams - they actually happened?"
    z "I suspect as much. But it's not your fault. You still don't know how to control and harness the powers of the Vision."
    ats "I can't control it. It seems like it is controlling me. I don't want to hurt people. Please... take it away from me."
    z "I'm afraid I can't do that. But I can do you one better - I have a Geo Vision of my own. How about I teach you how to use it?"
    ats "You want to teach me? I'm not sure that I can handle such power. What if I hurt someone on accident again?"
    p "You won't! Zhongli is a great teacher. Besides, the Traveler can also help."
    t "Yes, I can! I can also control the power of Geo. It is a bit simpler than conjuring mimics but it does the trick."
    ats "You three are willing to teach me how to control this... new power?"
    z "You can count on us, Miss Atsuko."

    p "Or that. Whatever floats your boat!"
